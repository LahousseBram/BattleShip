| Sometimes when clicking the random button ships are placed but they are not removed from the selection screen. | ?                | As stated we don't know how to reliably reproduce this behavior, we also think it is caused by serverlag. |

This isn't really a bug but for some features we don't have dedicated error messages. For example when clicking on place ships without placing any ships, it just says 'something went wrong' as the api gives an error.
